### Theory :
In Python, a tuple is a fundamental built-in data structure that is used to store an ordered collection of elements. Tuples are defined by placing elements inside parentheses and separating them with commas. They are capable of storing multiple values of different data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and characters within a single variable. One of the most important characteristics of a tuple is that it is immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, modified, added, or removed. This property distinguishes tuples from lists and makes them more reliable for storing data that should remain constant throughout the execution of a program.
Tuple elements can be accessed using indexing, where the position of each element starts from zero. This allows specific values to be retrieved easily. However, any attempt to update a value at a particular index results in a TypeError, reinforcing the immutability of tuples. Tuples do not support methods such as append(), remove(), or pop(), which are commonly used with lists. Despite these limitations, tuples provide several useful operations such as concatenation, which enables two or more tuples to be joined together to form a new tuple without modifying the original ones. Tuples also support repetition, slicing, and built-in functions like count() and index() to analyze stored data.
Another important concept studied in tuples is tuple unpacking, where the elements of a tuple are assigned to individual variables in a single statement. This improves code readability and simplifies data manipulation, especially when working with structured records. Tuples are commonly used in real-world applications where data integrity is crucial, such as storing student examination results, employee attendance records, database entries, and fixed configuration settings. Because tuples are immutable, they are faster to process and more memory-efficient compared to mutable data structures, making them suitable for performance-critical applications.
problem statement 1: A student's exam result is stored in the form of tuple containing three fixed fields: subject name, marks obtained and grade write a python program to: store the exam result using a tuple unpack the tuple elements into separate variables display the subjects,marksand grade

### Conclusion
Through this experiment, we gained an in-depth understanding of tuples and their role in Python programming. We learned how to create tuples, store multiple values, and access individual elements using indexing. The immutability of tuples was clearly demonstrated through various operations that resulted in errors when modification was attempted. We also studied different tuple operations such as concatenation and counting elements, which helped us understand how data can be combined and analyzed without altering the original structure. The concept of tuple unpacking was explored to extract and use individual values efficiently.
Practical applications such as student result analysis and employee attendance monitoring highlighted the usefulness of tuples in handling fixed and structured data. This experiment emphasized the importance of choosing the correct data structure based on program requirements. Overall, the study of tuples enhanced our understanding of data security, efficiency, and reliability in Python, making tuples an essential tool for managing unchangeable and well-organized data in real-world programming scenarios
